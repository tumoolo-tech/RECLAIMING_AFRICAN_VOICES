## 1. Type of Tool or Platform

**Ubuntu Heritage is a multilingual, cinematic digital-humanities platform** that combines four tool
types in one offline-capable app (a single Expo/React Native codebase → web + Android + iOS):

- **Interactive storytelling platform** — a cinematic "graphic-novel" reader that turns four
  foundational South African texts into illustrated, dual-mode (Child/Adult), read-aloud scenes.
- **Community oral-history archive** — a POPIA-compliant recorder where people capture, own, share
  and erase their own family histories; shared recordings sync to a live community feed.
- **Cultural & historical atlas + interactive timeline** — grounded, cited "map" of the heritage
  around the texts (heroes, customs, peoples, provinces, presidents, national days), plus a walkable
  1652 → today history Journey.
- **Creative / AI project** — cinematic AI-generated scene imagery and an "Ask Ubuntu" conversational
  guide, all built on a free-tier stack, with a blockchain **Heritage Ledger** for provenance.

**In one line:** *a storytelling platform + community archive + cultural atlas that reclaims South
Africa's foundational literature and heritage — and lets ordinary people become its authors.*

## 2. Methods & Approaches Used

**Humanities-first design.** Every feature traces back to a text, a custom, or a community need — not
to a technology we wanted to show off. Technology is deliberately kept *subordinate* to the humanities.

**Grounding & integrity ("truth only — no invented heritage").** Every historical claim traces to a
real source (the literature itself or cited references), surfaced as per-scene source notes and an
"About the Sources" screen. Contested history is presented *as contested*, never flattened into a
single official story. All AI-generated images and machine translations are **explicitly labelled** so
nothing machine-made is passed off as authoritative.

**Content-as-data architecture.** Texts, atlas entries, and all 11 languages live as structured data,
not hard-coded UI. Adding a new text or language is a data edit, never an app rewrite — which is what
makes the platform extensible and maintainable.

**Multilingual by construction.** The entire interface switches across eleven of South Africa's twelve official
languages (Sign Language, the twelfth, is not yet served). Literary content is **human-reviewed in English and Setswana**; the other nine are provided
as **machine-draft translations, clearly labelled "unreviewed,"** pending native-speaker review.

**Accessibility & connectivity-aware.** Built low-data and offline-capable: the reading core (text,
cached images, on-device narration) keeps working on poor or intermittent connections and cheap
Android phones. Dual Child/Adult reading levels, large tap targets, high contrast, scalable text.

**AI pipeline (free-tier, quota-safe).**
- *Cinematic imagery* — Google Gemini (pre-generated and cached as local assets) with a keyless
  Pollinations.ai fallback; images are dignified artistic interpretations, never fake photos of real
  named people.
- *Conversational guide ("Ask Ubuntu")* — a **retrieval-augmented (RAG)** assistant that answers
  **only from the site's own grounded content**; navigation is resolved deterministically (works with
  no key), and conversational replies use **Google Gemini** (grounded, truth-only prompt, replies in
  the chosen language), with a graceful key-free fallback to grounded snippets.
- *African-built AI (indigenous-first)* — wired to **Lelapa AI / Vulavula** (indigenous
  transcription/translation) and **Botlhale AI** (indigenous-language speech), so the tools that
  reclaim African voices are themselves African.

**Ethical data practice (POPIA by design).** A person's voice is personal information. Recording is
gated behind an explicit **consent** step; recordings are **private by default**, and the user can
**delete** them at any time (real erasure — bytes removed, on device and in the cloud). Cloud sharing
is protected by **Supabase Row-Level Security + anonymous authentication + hCaptcha**: private
recordings are readable by no one but their owner; only recordings the user chooses to share become
public.

**Verifiable provenance (blockchain, POPIA-safe).** The app's adaptations of the canon — three works
public domain, one (Mutwa) in copyright and summarised in our own words — are notarised on a public
blockchain (Solana devnet) — content hashes (SHA-256) + IPFS references + citations only, **never any
personal data** — so the record of what these works are and where they come from is permanent and
independently verifiable.

**Sustainability.** The whole stack runs on **free-tier infrastructure at zero monthly cost**, so the
platform can outlive the hackathon as a living, community-owned resource.

**Engineering discipline.** Pure logic is unit-tested under Node's test runner (218 tests on 2026-09-19; `npm test` is the source of truth); the web
build is verified green (`expo export`); the app is deployed on Vercel and a custom domain. The cloud
community archive was verified **end-to-end on the live site** (a shared recording confirmed present
in the database with readable audio).

**What is deferred (time-boxed, planned next).** Native-build offline persistence (WatermelonDB) and
inline film playback (web works today); deeper per-text scene coverage; native-speaker review to
promote the nine machine-draft languages; live Lelapa transcription and Botlhale neural voices (wired,
key-gated); "Mantswe a Batho," an oral-history *consensus* layer that surfaces agreement/divergence
without adjudicating; an Ingestion Library that turns public-domain books into cited modules; and
named heritage-certificate NFTs as a Phase-B extension of the ledger.
