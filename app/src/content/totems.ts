    title: "The ontology of the totem",
    body: [
      "Across the indigenous societies of Southern Africa, the bond between a human collective and the natural world is carried by a structured system of totemic affiliation — diboko or liboko among the Sotho-Tswana, iziduko or izithakazelo among the Nguni (Zulu, Xhosa, Ndebele), and mitupo among the Vhavenda. A totem — usually a wild animal, sometimes a plant or object — is not a badge or a self-chosen “spirit animal”. It is an ancestral guardian and the foundation of a clan's social identity.",
      "Unlike individualistic Western notions, a Southern African totem is inherited patrilineally — a standing contract binding each generation to a specific lineage. The Tshivenḓa proverb “Mutupo u tevhela ṅombe” (the totem follows the cattle) captures it: a child takes the father's totem, secured through the bridewealth (lobola / magadi) that moves with marriage.",
      "The system works as a socio-cosmological constitution: it sets the rules of exogamy that prevent incest, defines the hospitality owed to a travelling stranger, structures political rank under hereditary rulers, and serves as a map of memory — a way to read migrations, resolve splits, and hold ecological balance with the land.",

  {
    id: "fission",
    title: "Lineage fission: how totems are born",
    body: [
      "Totems emerged with the dynamics of Bantu migration and political fission. Sotho-Tswana and Nguni polities grew by “hiving off” — a junior chief or ambitious royal sibling breaking away to found a new group. The name Batswana itself is read as “the separatists”, those who could not hold together.",
      "When a group split, it needed a fresh marker: to tell itself apart from close kin, to avoid marrying its own relatives, and to anchor its new authority. So a new clan either adopted a new totem after a decisive event, or shifted the meaning of an old one.",
      "The “United Phofu (Eland) Confederacy” is the classic case. Around the 14th–15th centuries a series of succession crises broke it apart, and out of that fission came the Bahurutshe, Bakwena, Bangwaketse and Bangwato chiefdoms — each taking up its own totem for its own road.",

Rather than a war of extermination they made a relationship with the predator, adopting it as their seboko and branding their cattle with its image — placing their wealth under the apex beast.",

The totem therefore works as an oral archive — charting the clan's origins back to the warm Marico and Limpopo river systems. Tradition traces the line to Kwena, said to have led a splinter group south from the Bahurutshe after a severe drought around 1450–1480, taking the crocodile as an independent emblem.",
      "In Bakwena cosmology the crocodile is the clan's “godly father”: to kill one deliberately is likened to patricide, a taboo believed to disturb the rains. When a chief presides over the kgotla he is saluted “Ee, kwena!” (Yes, crocodile!), invoking the animal's patient, calculating judgment.",

Crossing the Leolo Mountains, they found a porcupine quill resting on an antheap and read it as an ancestral sign — the quill, the porcupine's defence, meant these mountains would be an impenetrable fortress. They abandoned the monkey for the noko.",
