// Journey quiz questions — one small check per milestone, tied to content/history-trail.ts.
//
// INTEGRITY (AGENTS.md §2). Two rules govern every question here:
//
//  1. The correct answer must be defensible from the milestone's own `note`, or from a branch under
//     it. Nothing is asked that the app has not already told the reader, from a cited source.
//
//  2. **A distractor must never teach a falsehood.** Where possible a wrong option is a REAL fact
//     from a different milestone — true, just not the answer to this question. The one deliberate
//     exception is the colonial "empty land" myth at 1652: it is offered precisely so that choosing
//     it is corrected on the spot, which is the opposite of teaching it.
//
// Strings are English-only, like the rest of the content layer; i18n/localize falls back to English
// honestly rather than passing off machine text as a reviewed translation.
