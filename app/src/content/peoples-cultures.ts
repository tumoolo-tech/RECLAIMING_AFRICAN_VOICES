// ("South African History And Culture.txt") and standard references. Integrity guardrails applied:
//  · The genetic-admixture table (Table 1) is DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED — race-science risk.
//  · Lineage chronology (e.g. "Tswana oldest") is framed as scholarly evidence, not a settled ranking.
//  · Customs are described with respect and context, neither sanitised nor sensationalised.
// NOTE(setswana): `tn` fields are AI-assisted DRAFTS for review by a Setswana speaker. [REVIEW]
