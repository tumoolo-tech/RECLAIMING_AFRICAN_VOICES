// Heroes of the Nation — South Africans, men and women, who gave something of themselves to the

// traces to the public record and is cited in `sources`. Contested legacies are told honestly —
// neither sanitised nor sensationalised (rule §6). Uncertain specifics are flagged [VERIFY] for

// until verified. This is a starter set — add figures the same way, always with a source.
