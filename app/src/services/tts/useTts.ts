// useTts — the one hook the UI calls for narration.
//
// It walks a LADDER of engines, chosen per language (see ./select.ts): ElevenLabs for English and
// Afrikaans, Botlhale for the indigenous languages it lists, on-device speech underneath everything.
// Any failure at one rung — no proxy, no network, a 429, an unsupported language — falls to the next,
// so "Listen" always does something and never dead-ends.
//
// Two properties worth stating plainly, because both are easy to lose in a refactor:
//
//   1. AN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE IS NEVER SENT TO ELEVENLABS. Not as a fallback, not "just to try".
//      ElevenLabs does not speak them and does not say so — it returns fluent, wrong pronunciation.
//      select.ts keeps it off the ladder and elevenlabs.ts refuses a second time.
//   2. THE SAME PASSAGE IS SYNTHESISED ONCE. The account allows 40 000 characters a month and one
//      passage is ~800 of them. Every remote clip goes through ./cache.ts first, keyed on the exact
//      text + language + voice, so a re-press, a Child⇄Adult flip and back, or tomorrow's visit all
//      cost nothing. Without that the Listen button stops working partway through the month.
//
// Only this file touches React/Expo; the mapping, request-building, selection and cache-key logic
// live in sibling pure modules that are unit-tested with `node --test`.
