// target so an answer can offer to open the relevant screen.
//
// Pure builder (no React, no side effects) so it can be reused by the retriever and unit-tested.

It was built for the AADHIH 'Reclaiming African Voices' hackathon (UNISA / BaobabX Academy). It covers four literary pillars, a Cultural Atlas, the nine provinces, the presidents, national days, totems and clans, and heroes of the nation — all grounded in cited sources with an integrity rule of no invented history.

Ubuntu Heritage speaks eleven of the twelve: the whole interface switches between them using the language picker. South African Sign Language is the one the app does not yet serve — there are no captions or signed video yet. The literary and heritage content is human-authored and human-reviewed in English and Setswana; the other nine languages are shown as machine translations that are clearly labelled 'unreviewed' until a native speaker reviews them, and otherwise fall back to English so nothing is ever passed off as authoritative.",
